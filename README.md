## ðŸ‘€ Reasoning in Image Generation

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been extensively explored by LLMs and LMMs in mathematics. However, it still remains an open question whether such strategies can be applied to **verifying and reinforcing image generation scenarios**. In this project, we provide ***the first*** comprehensive investigation of the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image generation.

We focus on three CoT reasoning techniques:
1. ***Scaling Test-time Computation*** for verification (ORM, PRM, and our proposed PARM and PARM++)
2. ***Aligning Model Preferences*** with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
3. ***Integrating These Techniques*** for complementary effects

Our results demonstrate that these approaches can be effectively adapted and combined to significantly improve the image generation performance:

Furthermore, given the pivotal role of reward models in our findings, we propose the ***P***otential ***A***ssessment ***R***eward ***M***odel (***PARM***) and ***PARM++***, specialized for autoregressive image generation:

1. ***PARM*** adaptively assesses each generation step through a potential assessment approach, merging the strengths of existing reward models.
2. ***PARM++*** further introduces a reflection mechanism to empower generative models to self-correct the previous unsatisfactory image.
